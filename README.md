# MongoDB transactions

This project contains:

- A report (in `doc/README.md`) on MongoDB transactions, that specifically focuses on ACID properties and distributed transactions.
- A NodeJS demo where I have simulated a few cases of write-conflict. You can find them in `test/transaction.test.js`.

If you find any mistakes, concepts difficult to understand or just descriptions worth to be improved, feel free to open an issue or create a PR.
